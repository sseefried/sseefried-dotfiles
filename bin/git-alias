#
# Aliases a git command, but only when in a git repository.
#
# $1 is the "alias name".  If we are not in a git repository then this command is called.
# $2 is the "git command". If we are in a git repository then this is used.
#
# The idea behind this script is to allow "context sensitive aliases".
# For example:
#
# alias ga='git-alias ga "git add"'
#
# creates and alias ga that means 'git add' when in a 
# git repository and 'ga' everywhere else.
#
# Note: The repetition of 'ga' in the definition is annoying but unavoidable as far as I can tell.
